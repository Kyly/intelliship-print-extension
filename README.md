# Intelliship Print Extension

Specific Project(s)
----
- Cross-browser plug-in or similar product that will enable the
company’s software product (Intelliship) to print documents and labels to a user’s printer
without encountering the browsers’ “dialogue box” and without incorporating java-based
third party printing tools (such as “QZ Print”).
- For clarity, when completed the software code written will enable an Intelliship user
to select “Print” from the Intelliship software and the selected or appropriate
documents will print to the appropriate printer(s) without any further action required
by user.
- The specific details of the desired software shall be provided via consultation with
the Chief Systems Architect and may incorporate options such that the user can, if
desired, view a “dialogue box”.
